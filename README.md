This work shows a trained agent capable of completing the first stage of world 1 of the Super Mario Bros. game. The environment in which all agents implemented were trained is based on the gym environment. Several algorithms have been used to test the agent's behaviour and learning and visuals are generated as well to monitor the performance. The algorithms tested are DQN, DDQN and Duelling DDQN.
